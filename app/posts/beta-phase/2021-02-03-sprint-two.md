Sprint two goals for beta involved testing the html prototype, specifically around:

* usability of start page
* usability of navigation on mobile and desktop
* remove any unwanted distractions from the design of start page and hub page


* * *

## Design artefacts

### Start page

#### Design decisions

What you need to know and Explore the topic sections were distracting and unnecessary. These have been removed.

* * *

### Hub page

![Hub page](/images/beta-sprint-two/02-hub-page.png)

#### Design decisions

* we added a heading to the grey box to make it clear and changed the line of text below to make it more descriptive

* removed the thick blue line underneath the areas of learning as it was acting as a block to users reading further down the page

* we removed the extra line of text under the Get help to improve… and Other useful resources as it wasn’t adding anything useful for users

### Mobile navigation

#### Design decisions

Users did not see the menu button to open the navigation, so we tested a version which made it more prominent.

### Resource page

#### Design decisions

* on mobile in particular, the quote from the EYFS framework was a long and dense block of text

* we tested showing only the first sentence, hiding the rest of the quote under a Read more link. We also put line breaks between each sentence

* we made the Maths resources header more descriptive, to help with SEO

* * *

## User insights

* Start page content was well received and understood by the users
* Users liked the title of the page but preferred “providers” to “professionals”
* Users recognised the areas of learning after reading the card labels
* Users were able to navigate to the resources pages easily
* Users saw the breadcrumbs and used them for navigation, the iterated mobile navigation still did not provide any improvements
