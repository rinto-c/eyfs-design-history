## Design artefacts

### Mobile navigation

#### Design decisions

We observed that users are freely moving between different sections of our service using breadcrumbs and device back button on mobile. In order to enhance the user experience, we trialled various iterations of the navigation by bringing it below the header, adding sticky functionality, but users did not use the navigation to get from one page to an other.

We wanted to test the navigation really well to understand whether any modifications are necessary to the [design system header with navigation](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/#header-with-service-name-and-navigation). Therefore we made the following modifications to the navigation to test in sprint four:

* removed navigation from the homepage and only displayed navigation when users land on one of the learning areas – based on the assumption that navigation should corelate sidebar on desktop

* moved the phase banner to the bottom of the page, just above the footer (from design system backlog, it was evident that the feedback link is not working well when placed in the beta banner)

* renamed the menu to something that makes sense to the user – 'EYFS resources'
